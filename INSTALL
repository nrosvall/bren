How to install Bren from the source code

    To compile and install Bren, you will need a fairly modern
    C compiler which supports C99 standard. You will also
    need GNU Make program.

    Bren also needs GNU Guile development files installed.
    For example on Fedora you would install them by using command:
    dnf install guile30 guile30-devel

    1) Extract the source code archive e.g bren-0.4.tar.gz
    2) Move to the Bren source code directory
    3) Type make. This will compile binary "bren".
    4) Type sudo make install. This will install bren to
    /usr/local/bin and bren.1 manpage to /usr/local/share/man/man1/bren.1.gz
    5) Run bren from terminal.
